# Blackjack
This is my interpretation of the popular casino game Blackjack, sometimes also known as 21, in python 3. The game allows for multiple players and gives users the option of hitting or staying. After the game ends, the program asks the users if they would like to play again or not and restarts the game if yes. 

## Input
1. Asks for the user to press the enter key if they would like to continue
2. Asks how many players there will be in this round
3. Individually asks each user if they would like to hit or stay
4. Asks if they want to play again or quit

## Output
The programs tells the user what their cards are and their total before and after their turns. At the end of the program it declares the winners among the users or lets them know the dealer won the round.
